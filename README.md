A quick page for testing and visualizing easing equations.

For animation/easing nerds.
===========================

I love to do custom easing equations. I feel like it's a way for a graphics developer or a designer to 
fingerprint an animation or design. And it shows a very intentional attention to detail.

This tool simply serves to better visualize and quickly test easing equations. 

It includes all the standards from the great Robert Penner (http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/), but 
also provides the ability copy them into a text field, edit them there, and then test them as you change tweak.

To use
------

Just clone this and run ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer`` from the root.
If you don't have python, run from apache, or nginx, or a node http server. Whatever your preference.


Targets Webkit browsers, but seems to work fine in IE9 and Mozilla.
